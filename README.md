# nixos-modules

Modules to be used in ***NixOS***.

A flake (to make usage easier) will follow shortly.

Will soon also include `home-manager` modules, until I get around to harmonising them and make pull requests to the HM repo.

Will (probably) be updated frequently.

## Future

This is supposed to be a kind of *staging* repo, eventually modules should be contributed to `nixpkgs` (first as flakes?) and `home-manager`.
